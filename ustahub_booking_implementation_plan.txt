- assets/js/mobile-sidebar.js: Functionality including auth state management
- Integration with all site pages

### Mobile Sidebar Fixes (May 2023)

- Fixed inconsistent paths in CSS references (changed from absolute to relative paths)
- Improved positioning of hamburger trigger button (moved to top left position)

### Provider Dashboard Enhancements (Phase 3) - PENDING 

### Multi-Language Support (May 2023)
The UstaHub platform now has robust internationalization (i18n) capabilities that enable seamless language switching between English, Russian, Kazakh, Arabic, and Uzbek.

#### Architecture & Organization
1. **Structured Language Files**
   - All translations are stored in JSON files in `/assets/lang/` directory
   - Each language has its own file: `en.json`, `ru.json`, `kk.json`, `ar.json`, `uz.json`
   - Translation keys are organized hierarchically by functional area

2. **No Inline Translations**
   - All UI text is loaded dynamically via data attributes
   - HTML elements use `data-i18n="key"` format for content
   - Input placeholders use `data-i18n-placeholder="key"`
   - ARIA labels use `data-i18n-aria-label="key"`

3. **RTL Language Support**
   - Arabic (and other RTL languages) are fully supported
   - Dedicated RTL stylesheet (`/assets/css/rtl.css`) handles all RTL-specific styling
   - Document direction is set dynamically based on language selection

#### Integration Guide
To add the language switcher to a page:

1. **Include Required Files**
   ```html
   <!-- Add these in the <head> section -->
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/lang-switcher.css">
   <script src="assets/js/lang.js" defer></script>
   ```

2. **Add the Language Switcher Component**
   ```html
   <!-- For navbar placement -->
   <div class="nav-item">
     <include src="components/language-switcher.html"></include>
   </div>
   
   <!-- For mobile sidebar (already integrated) -->
   <!-- For footer placement -->
   <div class="footer-language">
     <include src="components/language-switcher.html"></include>
   </div>
   ```

3. **Mark Elements for Translation**
   ```html
   <!-- Text content -->
   <h1 data-i18n="home.heroTitle">Find Local Service Providers</h1>
   
   <!-- Input placeholders -->
   <input type="text" data-i18n-placeholder="home.searchPlaceholder">
   
   <!-- Accessibility labels -->
   <button data-i18n-aria-label="common.close">&times;</button>
   ```

#### Adding New Languages
To add a new language:
1. Create a new JSON file in `/assets/lang/` directory
2. Copy structure from existing language file (e.g., `en.json`)
3. Translate all values (keep keys unchanged)
4. Add language code to the `availableLangs` array in `lang.js`
5. Add flag image to `/assets/img/flags/` directory

#### Testing
- Test language switching on all pages
- Verify RTL layout for Arabic
- Ensure all text elements are properly translated
- Check that user preferences are saved between sessions
